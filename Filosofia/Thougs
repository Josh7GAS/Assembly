i like this editor

it's not the way off look. this times i think that humanity is not cursened in evolution anymore, they just get into some called culture that fits there desires to give meaning ont the daily beases.

but maybe is just my mind not seeing the full pictures, they don't have much inspiration on live, they not strugles with their thogust or just fell really lonly to not share them.
maybe i do something like that, the things i see is only liquid, beagn for the deep of it and i'ven on that its just empty.

I was thinking in create historys about murders, gore like an old pulp novel.

Leet≈õ do basics first.

why?
Why no one kill or make some terrorism to make an statement or to protect some meaning, like when happens an homcide our someboody is dead because invade an proprety or try to rob an car, it's killed by some on that try to protect his values, and dosent care about the life of the pearson, and that's is reasanable, all the players should know what is the game about.

This necesity i have of doing something, not liking my parents behaveour, make me fills more and more ansious. I need to move on, be who i meant to be, realese myself of the strings that hold me back.
