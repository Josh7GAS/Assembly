Metacharacters

1) "." will match every thing expet by new lines 

with you wanna match the dot sing you use "\."

2) "\w" is for matcing alphanumeric values, so the negation of this meta is begining with "^"; Ex: ^\w but there is a metacharacter for "\w" as well, it is \W (Capital W)

3) "\d" to get the digits. The Negation ^\d, or \D

4) "\t" to matching tabs

5) "\n" to matching new lines. 

6) "\s" to matching the space. The Negation ^\s or \S



Tip:
To search for "[]" you can use \[\]
