Commands -> "(?misx)"

"m" is for itÂ´s related with the anchors, to catch the beging from every line of the string, works with "^" and with "$" 

"i" is for the case incesitive pattern 

"s" will match every string on the file 

"x" is for a mor readable regex you can add comments on the regex

to cancel the modifiers you have to use "-" as this: (?i)^[a-z]+\ (?-i)[A-Z]+ on the text:
